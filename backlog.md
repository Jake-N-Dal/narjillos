##Backlog

This backlog is organized by "type of user". Inside each sections, features are roughly prioritized.
I generally work on the high-priority features, but I pick the "user" that tickles my fancy each day.

###Physicist

* -

###Speed Demon

* Fix code for growing organs and bodies (currently weird and probably worth optimizing) °
* Check speed under Linux

###Gamer

* Externalize configurable parameters to YAML °
* Lock on eggs and the narjillo that will be born out of them.
* Try scrolling/panning commands under Linux

###Genetist

* Iterations in body plan °
* Ancestry browser °
* "Skip next" instruction in body plan °
* DNA diff during ancestry analysis
* Separate RGB color genes
* Whole-body size gene

###Ethologist

* Drifting eggs
* Narjillos eat eggs
* Narjillos eat each other

###Lab Technician

* Real arguments parsing (use --no-persistence together with other switches) °
* Single zipped savefile for both experiment and genepool °
* View locked narjillo (age, energy, times eaten, genome...) °
* Check git commit on experiment startup
* Automatically purge experiment temp file
* Automatically recover missing experiment from temp file
* Encode CPU floatpoint precision in the experiment id (instead of using strictfp)
* Make food more visible in normal view
* Make food more visible in infrared view

###Ecologist

* Conservation of energy in entire pond (with sun to give more energy)
* Multiple environments in multiple processes (with migration)
* Plant-like creatures instead of food (minimal energy expenditure? photosyntesis?)

###Artist

* Give a sense of movement when following a locked-on Narjillo (speckles in liquid?) °
* Light on/off visual and sound effects
* Smoother contours when zooming in infrared mode

##Neurologist

* Brains with behaviours

##Daydreamer

* Trigger evolutionary arms race
