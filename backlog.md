##Backlog

This backlog is organized by "type of user". Inside each sections, features are roughly prioritized.
I generally work on the high-priority features, but I pick the "user" that tickles my fancy each day.

###Physicist

* Watchdog for excessive speed (results in warning) °°
* Remove "tail wiggling dog" effect (probably requires conservation of MoI during update in vacuum) °°
  (see {163_180_006_231_095_236_202}{011_235_181_210_129_134_250} for a good case study)
* Smooth, inertial targeting

###Speed Demon

* Check speed under Linux
* Make FPS parametric to improve TPS on slower machines

###Gamer

* Externalize all configurable parameters to JSON files
* Try scrolling/panning commands under Linux
* Parameterize scroll/pan speeds

###Genetist

* View Narjillo's evolutionary path °°
* Ancestry browser °°
* Find a good way to deal with atrophy °°
* DNA diff during ancestry analysis °
* Narjillo's skewing is genetically determined for each organ °
* Separate RGB color genes
* Recursive body plan (creates multiple identical segments)
* Whole-body size gene

###Etologist

* Eggs °°
* "Egg-firing" °
* Additional cost for long-distance egg-flinging °
* Distance of firing is determined by genes °
* Skimming speed depends on metabolic rate
* Narjillos spend energy to reproduce
* Narjillos decide how much energy to give to descendants

###Lab Technician

* Track total running time for experiment °
* Dump isolated narjillos to file (instead of the console) °
* Slow motion setting °
* Lock on single narjillo °
* Zipped experiment files
* View narjillo stats (age, energy, times eaten...)
* Make food visible in normal view
* Make food visible in infrared view

###Ecologist

* Bug: PetriDish can miss notifications from pond (in particular, Narjillos dying when they spawn with very low or no energy) °°
  (This might not be the case anymore, but a good chance to check multithreading around the Ecosystem)
* Conservation of energy in entire pond (with sun to give more energy)
* Multiple environments in multiple processes (with migration)
* Plant-like creatures instead of food (minimal energy expenditure? photosyntesis?)

###Ethologist

* Narjillos are born small and then grow up °
* Narjillos eat each other
* "Fears" gene
* "Wants to eat" gene

###Artist

* Birth animation °°
* Light on/off visual and sound effects °
* Better death animation (right now the bending is not visible) °
* Fade out mouth/eye during death °
* Give a sense of movement when following a locked-on Narjillo (speckles in liquid?)

##Neurologist

* Brains with behaviours

##Daydreamer

* Trigger evolutionary arms race
