##First evo experiment
  * Swimmer consumes food (replenish energy, remove food)
  * Swimmer reproduces after eating (with mutation)
  * Cosmos lends to evolution (configuration and tweaking)
##Eye candy
  * Death animation
  * Eggs
  * Birth animation
##Realistic swimmers
  * Thicker segments exercise more push
  * Thicker segments require more energy
  * Real rotation
  * Swimmer updates food item when not existing anymore
  * Swimmer updates food item when not in range anymore
  * Swimmer spends energy to reproduce
##Better viewport
  * Clip viewport inside pond
  * Corner map
  * fly to target
  * Smooth overzooming
  * Smooth scrolling
  * Pan intertia
##Misc
  * Level Of Detail (probably not worth the effort - performance seems to simply depend on number of nodes)
  * Death of old age
