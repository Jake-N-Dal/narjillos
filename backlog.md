##Backlog

This backlog is organized by "type of user". Inside each sections, features are roughly prioritized.
I generally work on the high-priority features, but I pick the "user" that tickles my fancy each day.

###Physicist

* Viscosity to limit maximum speed (makes the current watchdog unnecessary) °°°
* Rewrite collision detection to be independent of max speed

###Speed Demon

* Fix code for growing organs and bodies (currently weird and probably worth optimizing) °°
* Adaptive graphics (disable effects when framerate plummets)

###Gamer

* Versioning system to replace Git commit °°°
* Downloadable build °°°
* Real arguments parsing (default to no-persistence, use --persistent together with other switches) °°°
* Check speed under Linux °°°
* Try scrolling/panning commands under Linux °°°
* Issue warning when Java 8 is not installed °°
* Zoo mode (switch from narjillo to narjillo) °
* Externalize configurable parameters to YAML °
* Tutorial
* Nice status bar
* GUI

###Genetist

* Ancestry Browser
* "Skip" instruction in body plan
* "Repeat" instruction in body plan
* DNA diff during ancestry analysis
* Separate RGB color genes
* Whole-body size gene

###Ethologist

* Narjillos eat eggs
* Narjillos eat each other

###Lab Technician

* Single zipped savefile for both experiment and genepool °°
* Generate eclipse/idea files from Gradle °
* Check version commit on experiment startup °
* Automatically purge experiment temp file °
* Automatically recover missing experiment from temp file °
* View stats for followed narjillo (age, energy, times eaten, genome...)
* Encode CPU floatpoint precision in the experiment id (instead of using strictfp)

###Ecologist

* Conservation of energy in entire dish (with sun to give more energy)
* Multiple environments in multiple processes (with migration)
* Plant-like creatures instead of food (minimal energy expenditure? photosyntesis?)

###Artist

* Light on/off visual and sound effects
* Smoother contours when zooming in infrared mode
* Make food more visible in normal view
* Make food more visible in infrared view

###Theologist

* Demiurge

##Neurologist

* Brains

##Daydreamer

* Trigger evolutionary arms race
