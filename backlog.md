This is my backlog for the Narjillo project. It's divided in sections by "type of user". Inside each sections, features are roughly prioritized.
I generally work on the high-priority features, but I pick the "user" that I want to be depending on my mood of the day.

###Physicist

* Uniform measure units (instead of had-hoc clipping and multiplying all over the place)

###Speed Demon

* Space Partitioning optimization
* Optimize physics engine
* Optimize infrared mode

## Computer Dummy

* Don't require Gradle to start the programs (only to build them)
* Externalize all configurable parameters to a JSON file
* Save Petri dish
* Load Petri dish

###Genetist

* Each body segment's amplitude is genetically determined
* Narjillo's skewing is genetically determined
* View Narjillo's evolutionary path
* Whole-body size gene
* Bullet-proof genome with a Chromosome class (for documentation, tool building and checking min and max values, for avoiding divisions by 0 and other potential issues)

###Ostetrician

* Eggs
* "Egg-firing"
* Additional cost for long-distance egg-firing
* Distance of firing is determined by genes
* Narjillos spends energy to reproduce
* Narjillos decide how much energy to give to descendants

###Lab Technician

* Bench with stats
* "Real Time" and "Fast" slider
* Light switch
* "Paused" setting in speed slider
* Select creature
* Export creature
* "Most Prolific" button
* View creature energy

###Environmentalist

* Narjillos eat each other
* Plants (food that evolves)
* Gamma rays (cause mutation)
* Beta rays (cause old age and death)
* Controllable food rate
* Controllable food calories

###Ethologist

* Narjillo updates food item when not in range anymore

###Artist

* Birth animation
* Speckles in liquid (or some other effect)

##Daydreamer

* DNA analyzer program
* DNA diff program (based on DNA analyzer)
* Sexual reproduction
* Sexual reproduction is optional
* Brains with behaviours
* Prevent DNA strands that are too different from mixing to favor speciation? (maybe bad idea b/c of deleterious mutations in small population)
