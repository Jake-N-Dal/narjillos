##More Complex Swimming
  * Genes determine delay
  * Genes determine amplitude
  * Real rotation
##More Realistic Swimmers
  * Energy consumption for a body segment depends on its children segments?
  * Swimmer updates food item when not existing anymore
  * Swimmer updates food item when not in range anymore
  * Swimmer spends energy to reproduce
##Eye candy
  * Death animation
  * Eggs
  * Birth animation
##Better viewport
  * Clip viewport inside pond
  * Corner map
  * fly to target
  * Smooth overzooming
  * Smooth scrolling
  * Pan intertia
##Misc
  * Profiled optimization
  * Level Of Detail (probably not worth the effort - performance seems to simply depend on number of nodes)
