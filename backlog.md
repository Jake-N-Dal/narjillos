##Backlog

This backlog is organized by "type of user". Inside each sections, features are roughly prioritized.
I generally work on the high-priority features, but I pick the "user" that tickles my fancy each day.

###Physicist

* Viscosity to limit maximum speed (makes the current watchdog unnecessary) °°
* Fix sketchy collision detection °
* Rewrite collision detection to be independent of max speed °

###Speed Demon

* Adaptive graphics (disable effects when framerate plummets)

###Gamer

* More intuitive track/untrack mouse commands °°
* Reliable tracking with double-click even at a distance °°
* Precise centering on newly tracked thing °°
* Limit panning inside space area °
* Pinch to zoom °
* Start without ancestry by default (to avoid OutOfMemory errors in the long run)
* Save/load experiment from menu
* "About"/"Help" menus
* Zoo mode (switch from narjillo to narjillo)
* Externalize configurable parameters to YAML
* Tutorial
* Run in a browser
* Package as native app for Mac
* Package as native app for Windows
* Nice status bar
* GUI
* Issue warning when Java 8 is not installed

###Genetist

* Ancestry Browser
* Duplicate during mutation instead of mirroring (to favour emergent complexity)
* "Skip" instruction in body plan
* "Repeat" instruction in body plan
* DNA diff during ancestry analysis
* Separate RGB color genes
* Whole-body size gene

###Ethologist

* Narjillos eat eggs
* Narjillos eat each other

###Lab Technician

* Serialize ancestry and experiment together in one file, not two separate files °°
* Enable passing entire id to Lab instead of just the experiment seed °
* Automatically purge experiment temp file °
* Automatically recover missing experiment from temp file °
* View stats for followed narjillo (age, energy, times eaten, genome...)
* Encode CPU floatpoint precision in the experiment id (instead of using strictfp)

###Ecologist

* Conservation of energy in entire dish (with sun to give more energy)
* Multiple environments in multiple processes (with migration)
* Plant-like creatures instead of food (minimal energy expenditure? photosyntesis?)

###Artist

* Make central area of dish visible at a distance
* Light on/off visual and sound effects
* Smoother contours when zooming in infrared mode
* Make food more visible in normal view
* Make food more visible in infrared view

###Developer

* Pass parameters to gradle tasks for experiment, petri and ancestry

###Theologist

* Demiurge

##Neurologist

* Brains

##Daydreamer

* Trigger evolutionary arms race
