##Backlog

This backlog is organized by "type of user". Inside each sections, features are roughly prioritized.
I generally work on the high-priority features, but I pick the "user" that tickles my fancy each day.

###Physicist

* Viscosity to limit maximum speed (makes the current watchdog unnecessary) °°
* Fix sketchy collision detection °
* Rewrite collision detection to be independent of max speed

###Speed Demon

* Fix code for growing organs and bodies (currently weird and probably worth optimizing) °°
* Adaptive graphics (disable effects when framerate plummets)

###Gamer

* Click-and-drag to move with the mouse (instead of just clicking) °°
* More intuitive track/untrack mouse commands °°
* Real arguments parsing (default to no-persistence, use --persistent together with other switches) °°
* Issue warning when Java 8 is not installed °°
* Zoo mode (switch from narjillo to narjillo) °
* Externalize configurable parameters to YAML °
* Tutorial
* Nice status bar
* GUI

###Genetist

* Ancestry Browser
* Duplicate during mutation instead of mirroring (to favour emergent complexity)
* "Skip" instruction in body plan
* "Repeat" instruction in body plan
* DNA diff during ancestry analysis
* Separate RGB color genes
* Whole-body size gene

###Ethologist

* Narjillos eat eggs
* Narjillos eat each other

###Lab Technician

* Enable passing entire id to Lab instead of just the experiment seed °
* Automatically purge experiment temp file °
* Automatically recover missing experiment from temp file °
* Serialize ancestry and experiment together in one file, not two separate files
* View stats for followed narjillo (age, energy, times eaten, genome...)
* Encode CPU floatpoint precision in the experiment id (instead of using strictfp)

###Ecologist

* Conservation of energy in entire dish (with sun to give more energy)
* Multiple environments in multiple processes (with migration)
* Plant-like creatures instead of food (minimal energy expenditure? photosyntesis?)

###Artist

* Disable input until viewport has stabilized at start °
* Light on/off visual and sound effects
* Smoother contours when zooming in infrared mode
* Make food more visible in normal view
* Make food more visible in infrared view

###Developer

* -

###Theologist

* Demiurge

##Neurologist

* Brains

##Daydreamer

* Trigger evolutionary arms race
