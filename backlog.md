This is my backlog for the Narjillo project.
It's divided in sections by "type of user". Inside each sections, features are roughly prioritized.
I generally work on the high-priority features, but I pick the "user" that tickles my fancy each day.

###Physicist

* Narjillos pivot round their center of mass, not around their mouths °°°
* Uniform measure units (instead of had-hoc clipping and multiplying all over the place) °
* Fix "shaking" of limbs in some Narjillos

###Speed Demon

* Space Partitioning for fast thing searches °°
* Optimize physics engine °°
* Optimize infrared mode °
* Space Partitioning runs in a separate thread
* Switch to fast math library
* Make FPS parametric to improve TPS on slower machines

###Gamer

* Try scrolling/panning commands and speeds under Linux °°
* Parameterize scroll/pan speeds °
* Externalize all configurable parameters to JSON files
* Save Petri dish
* Load Petri dish

###Genetist

* Narjillo's color is an expression of its behaviour (amplitude, phase, etc) °°
* Narjillo's skewing is genetically determined °°
* Whole-body size gene
* View Narjillo's evolutionary path
* Mutation rate is controlled by genes (this is what happens in nature)
* DNA analyzer program
* DNA diff program (based on DNA analyzer)
* Sexual reproduction
* Sexual reproduction is optional
* Prevent DNA strands that are too different from mixing to favor speciation? (maybe bad idea b/c of deleterious mutations in small population)

###Ostetrician

* Eggs °°
* "Egg-firing" °
* Additional cost for long-distance egg-flinging °
* Distance of firing is determined by genes °
* Narjillos spends energy to reproduce
* Narjillos decide how much energy to give to descendants

###Lab Technician

* Lock on single Narjillo °
* Bench with stats
* "Real Time" and "Fast" slider
* Light switch
* "Paused" setting in speed slider
* Select creature
* Export creature
* "Most Prolific" button
* View creature energy

###Ecologist

* Multiple environments in multiple processes (with migration, still deterministic - but how?)
* Plants (food that evolves)
* Gamma rays (cause mutation)
* Beta rays (cause old age and death)
* Controllable food rate
* Controllable food calories

###Ethologist

* Narjillos eat each other °°
* Narjillo updates food item when not in range anymore
* "Attracted to" gene (uses other Narjillo's colors to select most desirable mate)
* "Fears" gene (like "attracted to")
* "Wants to eat" gene (like "attracted to")

###Artist

* Birth animation °
* Give a sense of movement when following a locked-on Narjillo
* Speckles in liquid (or some other effect)

##Neurologist

* Brains with behaviours

##Daydreamer

* Trigger evolutionary arms race
