# from experiment 972201438-0.5.0, a quadruped (for once) that can really swim. It stayed quadruped for most of the germline. It evolved with energy expenditure = 0.2, but I tuned that down to 0.1 in the last few hundreds or so generations. This prompted the movements of the creature to evolve and become smoother.
