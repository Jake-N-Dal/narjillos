# The result of experiment 501888497, around 70-70K ticks. This experiment has very little
# food, and this apparently favoured evolution by putting a lot of selective pressure over
# the creatures. This narjillo is slim, pretty fast, and it turns incredibly fast - faster
# than anything I've seen so far.
