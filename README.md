#Narjillos

Just one of my own private obsessions: artificial life and evolutionary algorythms. In Java.
Strongly inspired by Jeffrey Ventrella's GenePool (http://www.swimbots.com).

##How to run it

This is still heavily in development, so I didn't bother to make it user-friendly. However, it's easy to run if you have Java 8:

    git clone https://github.com/nusco/narjillos.git
    cd narjillos/petridish/
    ../gradlew run
